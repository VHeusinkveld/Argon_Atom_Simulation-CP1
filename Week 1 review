Our program can be found in 'main.pynb' 

* What you are trying to achieve right now
We have to perfect te renormalisation of the particle speeds (for achieving the correct T(emperature)). 
Apart from that, we are implementing computation of the system property's (pair correlation functin, pressure, C_v)

* What checks do you perform to see if what you are doing is correct.
We check if the total energy in the system is conserved. (by evaluation of SUM(E_pot, E_kin))
We check if the temperature of the system agrees to the one we 'set'. (after renormalising the particle speeds)
We check if the phases mentioned in Jos' book agree with the animations. (solid, gas, liquid)
    > In solid state, for example, the atoms should stay in a FCC structure (and they do in our program)

* What do these checks show. If you use a plot to verify correctness, attach this plot
We will add this later. (so far they all seem to be correct)

* If the checks pass, write what is next in your plan
See answer at 1 

* If the checks fail, discuss what you can try next to fix the problem.
