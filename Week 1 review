Our program can be found in 'main.pynb' 

* What you are trying to achieve right now
We have to perfect te renomalization of the speed (for achieving the correct T). 
Appart from that we are implementing computatoin of system property's (pair correlation functin, pressure, C_v)

* What checks do you perform to see if what you are doing is correct.
We check if the total Energy is conserved in the system. (by evualuation E_pot, E_kin)
We check if the temperature of the system, agrees to the one we 'set'. (after renormalizing speed)
We check if the phases mentioned in Jos' book agree with the animations. (solid, gas, liquid)
    > In solid for example the atoms should stay in a FCC structure (and they do)

* What do these checks show. If you use a plot to verify correctness, attach this plot
We will add this later. (so far they all seem to be correct)

* If the checks pass, write what is next in your plan
See answer at 1 

* If the checks fail, discuss what you can try next to fix the problem.
