* What you are trying to achieve right now
We have to perfect te renomalization of the speed (for achieving the correct T). 
Appart from that we are implementing computatoin of system property's (pair correlation functin, pressure, C_v)

* What checks do you perform to see if what you are doing is correct.
We check the E_kin and E_pot, 

* What do these checks show. If you use a plot to verify correctness, attach this plot
* If the checks pass, write what is next in your plan
* If the checks fail, discuss what you can try next to fix the problem.
